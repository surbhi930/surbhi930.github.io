  Hi, my name is Surbhi Singh and I'm a software engineer with over 5 years experience in backend development.
  I am currently working at Teradata on their orchestration tool for Data streaming, backup and restore, called DTU.
  
  With five years of experience, including two years at an R&D lab, 
  I have gained a solid understanding of database systems and conducting research. 
  I am eager to further my knowledge and delve deeper into these areas through a comprehensive research program. 
  My research interests lie in database systems, programming language, and machine learning.

          Currently working as an R&D Engineer in building data migration tools. 
          
          Led the development of Incremental backup & restore features and Dictionary only migration to reduce migration downtime.
          Implemented online system migration capability and pause and resume functionality.
          Developed a downtime estimator tool to give an estimate of the migration to the customers in advance of the actual migration happening. 
          This helps the customers to plan downtime in advance.
          
          Gathered customer feedback and proposed a solution to implement Dictionary level migration in a hackathon. 
          The prototype was selected in Top 5.
          Trained and mentored junior programmers in programming methodologies and best practices.

      During my free time, I enjoy indulging in various activities and reading, traveling, and music are my favorites.
      I have had the pleasure of visiting over 15 states within India, experiencing diverse cultures and landscapes.
      
      Presently, I am pursuing a Diploma in Hindustani Classical Music at Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. 
      In addition to music, I have discovered another creative hobby: sewing. 
      I find immense satisfaction in crafting my own clothes and 
      my ultimate aspiration is to curate a wardrobe filled with garments that I have created.
